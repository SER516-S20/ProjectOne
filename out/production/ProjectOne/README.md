# ProjectOne
The simplest project ever

This is our goal to be completed before 4:30pm on Thursday

You will notice in Canvas a "homework" called studentID. It has a "grade". It is not a homework and it is not a grade is just a consecutive number assigned to you. Again, it is not a "grade", it is your ID number (1 to 39). Every one of you have a unique ID. Use that number in the name of the file that you submit. There are 3 options:
 

Panel_XX.java is the name of your class  if you are doing a JPanel (35 of you are) - replace XX with your ID
Tab_XX.java is the name of your class  if you are doing a JTabbedPane  (3 of you are) - replace XX with your ID
Frame_XX.java is the name of your class  if you are doing a JFrame  (Only 1 of you is) - replace XX with your ID.
In the repository, I have posted one example for each (Panel, Tab, and Frame). Follow the example create and test your file.
 

Panel owners, it should be very very easy for you. 
Tab owners, could be tricky, do your best and we will talk during class. BUT submit a file 
Frame owner, it is OK to just change my ID (00) for yours. No work needed. BUT change the ID so you take property of the file. 
 

So, what you should do:

a) Have access to GitHub - MANDATORY. TA will help you Amit (apande36@asu.edu)
b) Post a file to the repository (Each of YOU post the file, not your  friend)
c) Name of the file Frame_XX, Panel_XX, or Tab_XX where XX is your ID. View your ID in the grade section of Canvas
d) Content of your file â€“what we discussed in class (review the examples posted as user 0, Frame_0, Tab_0, Panel_0)
